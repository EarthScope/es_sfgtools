class WorkflowABC(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for seafloor geodesy workflow implementations.

    This class provides a standardized framework for managing hierarchical contexts
    in seafloor geodesy data processing workflows. It handles the organization of
    data across four hierarchical levels: network → station → campaign → survey.

    The class supports two operational modes:
    
    1. **Setup workflows** (mid_process_workflow=False): For initial data organization
       and directory structure creation
    2. **Mid-process workflows** (mid_process_workflow=True): For scientific data
       processing with metadata validation and loading

    Attributes
    ----------
    mid_process_workflow : bool, default False
        Flag indicating whether this is a mid-process workflow that requires
        metadata validation and loading.
    directory : Path
        Root directory for the workflow data structure.
    directory_handler : DirectoryHandler
        Handler for managing the hierarchical directory structure.
    asset_catalog : PreProcessCatalogHandler
        Handler for managing data asset catalogs and metadata.
    current_network_name : str or None
        Name of the currently active network.
    current_network_dir : NetworkDir or None
        Directory handler for the current network.
    current_station_name : str or None
        Name of the currently active station.
    current_station_dir : StationDir or None
        Directory handler for the current station.
    current_station_metadata : Site or None
        Metadata object for the current station (loaded in mid-process workflows).
    current_campaign_name : str or None
        Name of the currently active campaign.
    current_campaign_dir : CampaignDir or None
        Directory handler for the current campaign.
    current_campaign_metadata : Campaign or None
        Metadata object for the current campaign (loaded in mid-process workflows).
    current_survey_name : str or None
        Name of the currently active survey.
    current_survey_dir : SurveyDir or None
        Directory handler for the current survey.
    current_survey_metadata : Survey or None
        Metadata object for the current survey (loaded in mid-process workflows).

    Notes
    -----
    The hierarchical context system ensures data organization consistency across
    different workflow implementations. Each level must be set in order:
    network → station → campaign → survey.

    Context switching at any level automatically resets all dependent lower levels
    to maintain data integrity and prevent cross-contamination between different
    organizational contexts.

        Initialize the workflow with directory structure and handlers.

        Sets up the basic infrastructure for workflow operations including directory
        management, asset catalogs, and hierarchical context tracking. All context
        attributes are initialized to None and must be set using the appropriate
        context methods.

        Parameters
        ----------
        directory : Path, optional
            Root directory path for the workflow. If not provided, must supply
            directory_handler. Used to initialize DirectoryHandler if needed.
        asset_catalog : PreProcessCatalogHandler, optional
            Pre-configured asset catalog handler. If not provided, will be created
            automatically using the directory handler's asset catalog database path.
        directory_handler : DirectoryHandler, optional
            Pre-configured directory handler. If not provided, will be created from
            the directory parameter and built automatically.
        station_metadata : Site, optional
            Pre-loaded station metadata for workflows that start with known station
            context. Typically used in mid-process workflows.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If both directory and directory_handler are None. At least one must be
            provided to establish the workflow's file system context.

        Notes
        -----
        The initialization process follows this sequence:

        1. Validate that either directory or directory_handler is provided
        2. Create DirectoryHandler if not supplied and build directory structure
        3. Create PreProcessCatalogHandler if not supplied
        4. Store all handlers and directory references
        5. Initialize all hierarchical context attributes to None

        All hierarchical context attributes (network, station, campaign, survey) are
        set to None during initialization. Use the set_* methods to establish the
        working context before performing workflow operations.

        The directory handler is automatically built during initialization if created
        from a directory parameter, ensuring the full directory structure exists
        before workflow operations begin.

    ):
        """
        Set the current network, station, and campaign contexts in sequence.

        Convenience method that establishes the complete hierarchical context
        (network → station → campaign) in a single call. This is equivalent to
        calling set_network(), set_station(), and set_campaign() in sequence,
        but with parameter validation to ensure all are strings.

        Parameters
        ----------
        network_id : str
            The identifier for the network to activate. This should match the
            expected directory name and serve as a unique network identifier.
        station_id : str
            The identifier for the station to activate. This should match both
            the directory name and station identifier in metadata files.
        campaign_id : str
            The identifier for the campaign to activate. This should match both
            the directory name and campaign identifier in station metadata.

        Raises
        ------
        AssertionError
            If any of the input parameters are not strings.

        ValueError
            If any of the individual context setting operations fail. Error
            messages will indicate which specific context failed to set.

        Notes
        -----
        The method performs parameter validation before calling the individual
        context setting methods:

        1. Validate all parameters are strings
        2. Call set_network(network_id)
        3. Call set_station(station_id)  
        4. Call set_campaign(campaign_id)

        This method is particularly useful for workflows that need to establish
        a known hierarchical context at startup, such as processing workflows
        that operate on specific campaign data.

        All the same rules and behaviors of the individual set_* methods apply,
        including metadata loading for mid-process workflows and directory
        creation for setup workflows.

    def set_survey(self, survey_id: str):
        """
        Set the current survey context within the current campaign.

        Establishes the survey-level context, which represents an individual
        measurement session within a campaign. Surveys are the finest-grained
        organizational unit and contain the actual observational data and
        processing results.

        This method is only available for mid-process workflows as it requires
        access to campaign metadata to validate survey existence and load
        survey-specific configuration parameters.

        Parameters
        ----------
        survey_id : str
            The identifier for the survey to activate. This should match the
            survey ID defined in the current campaign's metadata and correspond
            to the survey directory name.

        Raises
        ------
        AssertionError
            If mid_process_workflow=False (survey context only available for
            mid-process workflows), or if survey_id is not a string.

        ValueError
            If the survey is not found in the current campaign metadata, or if
            the survey directory cannot be created or accessed.

        Notes
        -----
        The method performs these operations in sequence:

        1. Validate mid_process_workflow=True and survey_id is string
        2. Reset survey context via _reset_survey()
        3. Search current campaign metadata for matching survey
        4. Load Survey object into current_survey_metadata
        5. Retrieve or create SurveyDir object from current_campaign_dir
        6. Store the SurveyDir in current_survey_dir

        The decorator @validate_network_station_campaign ensures that network,
        station, and campaign contexts are properly established before this
        method can be called.

        Survey metadata includes measurement timestamps, instrument configurations,
        data quality parameters, and processing settings specific to that
        measurement session.
