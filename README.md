# EarthScope Seafloor Geodesy Tools

This repo contains a python library `es_sfgtools` designed to enable users to preprocess raw GNSS-A data from SV2 and SV3 wavegliders, as well as run GNSS-A processing using [GARPOS](https://github.com/s-watanabe-jhod/garpos)

The library will be published on PyPi, and installable as follows
